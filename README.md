1. ABOUT\

	Metroidvania in the style of a SNES era game. 512x448 resolution.\



2.STORY AND SETTING\

	In order to survive an impending cataclysm, the people of Society XXXX developed a last ditch survival plan to preserve their society beyond the destruction of their home world. An extremely large interstellar object (Pluto sized) was observed entering their solar system. The people of Society XXXX planned to construct a small survival station in the belly of that rogue planetoid. They sent a team of scientists and technicians to establish the station, which consisted of a small agri-dome, small living quarters, robotic "shepherds", and a cryo-system. After the enclave was established, this team entered the cryo-system. They had programmed  the cryo system to wake them periodically in order to assess the ever changing local of the planetoid for possible environments to colonize.

	Millenia pass, and no new planet has been discovered. As the planetoid Is leaving XX solar system, two massive comets strike the surface of the planetoid, wreaking havoc. The seismic impact of the comets changes the landscape of the planetoid drastically, creating two large basins. One of the comets strikes a methane rich vein in the planetoid and unlocks a vast methane sea. The second does not, and creates a massive sunken desert. The impact also is sufficient to disrupt the plans of society XXXX: the resultant earthquakes disable the cryo-system and create a leak in the bio-dome. Over time, the inhabitants of the station die. The bio-dome however, seeds the planetoid with the life which XXXX brought with them. Lastly the impact of the comets diverts the trajectory of the planetoid so that it falls into the orbit of the nearest star. It winds up in a tidally-locked orbit with that star. The planetoid develops a light side and a dark side. Not everything that Society XXXX built in the planetoid is destroyed however. The robotic shepherds survive, and quietly continue to function.

	Time goes on. Eons pass. The planetoid settles into an asteroid belt in its solar system. A separate civilization which is conducting survey of nearby stellar bodies sends a probe to our planetoid. A capsule containing an automated robo-probe crash lands in the side of a mountain. The crash landing seems to destroy the capsule, and its contents.

	A small rodent like creature which inhabits the planetoid (seeded from XXXX) inadvertently scurries over the trashy body of that robotic probe, and somehow activates the probe. The probe comes to at the start of the game, very broken and hardly able to traverse its surroundings. This is the start of the game. The robot is the player character.



3. PLAYER CHARACTER CONCEPTS\

	BACK STORY:\

	Alien bipedal probe. Designed as a research robot with a strong, specific purpose. It's crash landing disrupts that purpose. The probe's initial mission in the game is to self-repair. The game should feel like a process of self-discovery, actualization and recovery. The robot will interface with XXXX technology and undergo an alchemical process that causes it to become a unique lifeform with self-awareness and determination. The probe will discover metals to upgrade itself, as well as various bits of tech (far-flung pieces of its capsule, as well as XXXX tech). As the probe rebuilds itself, it begins to radiate a signal that it's creators discover (creators will attempt to selfishly mine/harvest the resources of the planet). Also, via interactions with the "shepherds" it will become protective of the XXXX enclave. It will understand the life occupying the planet as the survivors of XXXX as well. The Creators of the Probe will have to be deterred. At end of game it is the custodian of the planetoid, guarding it as long as it can.

	UPGRADE IDEAS:\

	Upgrades will be found either as entire bits of tech, or the probe will harvest metallic veins to give it raw materials to develop its own upgrades. These self-made upgrades will mimic the life on the planet. They will also be reskins of different metals (a la Varia Suit in Metroid) to indicate heat resistance/etc. Some of these upgrades will be arm replacements, leg replacements/whatever the probe should feel very modular, very like a fun robot.

	GAME PLAY MECHANICS:\
	
	No jump!
	Light Source (different types of light?)
	Jet Pack (for hovering only, not vertical climbing (OoT hoverboots vibe maybe)
	Drill
	Grappling Hook
	Speedy wheels
	Wall climb
	Compact mode
	Metallic upgrades (for defense/heat/cold/water)



4. AREAS\

4A.LIGHT SIDE:\

	The light side of the planet would be mostly barren.  It is full of craters, plains and mountains. Certain lifeforms have begun 	to adapt to and live on the surface, but it is largely quiet and moon-like. Occasional meteorites strike the surface. The 		vegetation leaking from XXXX has yet to adapt to the harsh exposure of the surface. Many caves lead underground, and that is 		where life is thriving most.
	
	AREAS OF NOTE:\

	Starting Area/Lowlands:

	This area will also be where XXXX- drilled into the center of the planet from. The mineshaft they used will be discoverable.

	COLOR SCHEME:\
	Yellow, brown, and grey\
	near cavemouths there will be some green and grasses\

	FEATURES IN AREA\
	-A mountain acts as a barrier between this area and the dark side of the planet.  The mountain is on of the the planetoids 		poles.
	-Probe Capsule crash site (starting area)
	-A cave mouth leading to the Subterranean Jungle
	-A smaller mountain to explore once you've gained more mobility.  If you cross this mountain you access a more difficult 		lightside area, which contains the lava falls that fall from the Highlands.


	Subterranean Jungle:\

	Home to most of the life on the planet. A wide variety of life lives here, especially vegetation. Sort of like the first area in 	Super Metroid. There is liquid water here, to create ponds and falls. The life in this area was seeded by the cracking of the bio 	dome created by XXXX.

	COLOR SCHEME:\
	Greens, Blues, brown, gold(wheat-gold)\

	FEATURES IN AREA:\
		-TBD
		
		
	Highlands:

		There is an elevated plateau covering roughly 33% of the Light side. This area is much hotter than the rest of the light 	side. There is lava, deadly gas and other dangers there. This area is also more prone to meteorite strikes. There is a volcano 		there. Certain creatures have adapted to the heat. There is a lava-fall that acts as a barrier between this area and the 		Lowlands.

	COLOR SCHEME:\
	Reds, browns, oranges, blacks, and greys.\
	
	FEATURES IN AREA:\
	-Lava-fall that acts as a barrier between this area and the Lowlands.



	Volcanic Caves:\

	This is the area directly beneath the highlands. Large lava flows have carved out massive caverns here that run directly to the 	planetoids core.

	COLOR SCHEME:\
	Reds, browns, oranges, blacks, and greys.

	FEATURES IN AREA:\
	-TBD

4B. DARK SIDE:\
